# Identify and search within specific journals

When doing research, it can often be helpful to start your search within specific journals that are related to your topic or discipline.

## Identify disciplinary journals
* Visit the <a href="https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank">University of Idaho Library website</a>
* Click on `Databases A-Z` below the search box
* In the drop-down box, scroll to and select `Journal Citation Reports`, click on go
* On the new page, click on `Browse by Journal`
* On the new page, click on `Select Categories`
* Scroll down to and check the box for a specific discipline
  * Example: Political Science
* Scroll down and click on `Submit` at the bottom of the page

You can now see a ranked list of journals within a specific discipline. Journals in this list are ranked based on the number of times their articles are cited by other articles.

## Confirm if a journal is peer-reviewed
Once you select a journal, you can visit its website to determine whether it is peer-reviewed.

* Within `Journal Citation Reports`, click on the title of a journal
  * Example: *American Journal of Political Science*
* Identify the `publisher`
  * Example: Wiley
* Open a new tab and go to your search engine of choice
* Search for the `name of the journal` and the `publisher`
  * Example: *American Journal of Political Science* Wiley
* Visit the journal's website
* Review content such as `Aims and Scope`, `About`, `Author Guidelines`, etc. to determine whether the journal is peer-reviewed
  * Journals may also use terms such as `refereed`, `single-blind review`, `double-blind review`, etc. as synonyms for `peer-review`
